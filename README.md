# Cellular_Automata
This is a project that I developed during my MSE. It belongs to the subject of dynamical systems and it is developed a simple Cellular Automata based on the Rule90 algorithm.

There are different python files, each representing a different part of the project. There is also a generalization of this project to two dimensions.

The .pdf file contains all the results and its corresponding explanation.
